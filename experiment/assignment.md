1. Write ARM Assembly Language Programs computing the following expressions or program segments.

  1. Variables are of type unsigned integers and word sized. Also the variables b, c, d and e are initialized to values 10, 20, 30 and 40 respectively.

        a = (b + c) - (d + e)

  2. Variables are of type signed integers and half-word sized.Variables b, c, d and e are initialized to values -10, 20, 30 and -40 respectively.

        a = (b + c) - (d + e)

  3. Variables are of type unsigned integers and word sized. Also the variables b, c, d and e are initialized to values 10, 20, 30 and 40 respectively.

        b = a + 256 .
        c = b - 0xfffff
        a = (b + c) - (d + e + 0xffffe)

  4. Dot Product of two signed half-word sized integer array vectors A and B each of dimension 5. The resultant dot-product value should reside in the register $r1 by the end of computation.  
  5. A and B are two unsigned word-sized integer array vectors each of size dimension 5. Compute the following expression.

        CONV = A[0] * B[4] + A[1] * B[3] + A[2] * B[2] + A[3] * B[1] + A[4] * B[0]


2. Write ARM Assembly Language Programs equivalent to the following C-code fragements.

  1. if ( a < b) {         // a and b are signed integers
       c = a - b;
    }

  2. if ( a < b) {         // a and b are unsigned integers
       c = a - b;
    }

  3. if ( a < -1234) {         // a is a signed integer
       a = 4 * a ;
    }
    else {
       a = a/4;
    }

  4. if ( a < b ) {         // a, b, c are unsigned integer
       if ( a < c) {
          min = a;
       }
       else {
    min = b < c ? b : c;
    }
    }
    else {
       min = b < c ? b : c
    }


3. Write ARM Assembly Language Programs equivalent to the following C-code fragments..

  1. sqrsum = 0;
     for( i = 0 ; i < 100; ++i)
        sqrsum = sqrsum + a[i] * a[i];

  2. convsum = 0;
     for ( i = 0, j = 99; i <100; ++i, --j )
         convsum += a[i] * b[j] ;

  3. sum = 0;
     for( i = 0 ; i < 100; ++i)
       for( j = 0; j < 100; ++j)
          sum = sum + a[i, j] ;
